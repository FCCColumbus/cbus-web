# Free Code Camp Columbus 2022 Website

Welcome to the new and improved Free Code Camp Columbus Website!

Free Code Camp is an open source learning community that helps beginner coders learn to develop for the web. Free Code Camp Columbus is a sub-group called a campsite loosely affiliated with the parent group of Free Code Camp. Here at Free Code Camp Columbus we have created a group website to bring all of our many group interaction technologies into one unified application to grow as a group and also learn to code along the way.
