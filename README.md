# Free Code Camp Columbus 2022 Website

Welcome to the new and improved Free Code Camp Columbus Website!

Free Code Camp is an open source learning community that helps beginner coders learn to develop for the web. Free Code Camp Columbus is a sub-group called a campsite loosely affiliated with the parent group of Free Code Camp. Here at Free Code Camp Columbus we have created a group website to bring all of our many group interaction technologies into one unified application to grow as a group and also learn to code along the way.

# Installation Instructions

- Prerequisites: Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. If you don't have it installed checkout this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-on-windows-2/) which will give you a step by step process of downloading it.

- First, open your terminal at the correct location (where you want to download the code), and in this Github repository click the green button Code (top right).

- It should open a dropdown. Copy the link under HTTPS and go back to your terminal. Type in `git clone <link>` (note: include the link you copied instead of `<link>`).

- Once everything is done downloading, type in `cd cbus-web`, and then `npm install` right after.

- Node will download a bunch of packages. After it is done you are ready! Type in `npm start` in your terminal to open the app in your web browser, or `code .` to open the code.
